      <h2>A. Meaningful Experiences</h2>
      <p>
        This week, I genuinely felt a significant increase in my knowledge and understanding through the tasks assigned. The morning debriefings with the chief librarian and other librarians were particularly valuable, as it was insightful to hear about everyone's learning and positive experiences during their internships. Additionally, Ma'am Erlinda told Sir Owa to tour us through the criminology, dentistry, and business libraries, which were noticeably more modern compared to the libraries in Buildings 2 and 3. With that, I realized that every task this week deepened my practical understanding of library operations.
      </p>

      <h2>B. Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        For me, the morning debriefings highlighted the importance of sharing knowledge and positive experiences within a library. Hearing about others' positive experiences provided me with new ideas and truly valued the purpose of my own internship. While visiting the different libraries in other buildings also demonstrated that a library is actively adapted to meet the specific needs of various students. Also, the quiet and focused atmosphere in EAC libraries underscored the crucial role of the right study environment for different students and their course.
      </p>

      <h2>C. Best Practices and Features of the Library</h2>
      <p>
        One excellent practice I've consistently observed at EAC is the effective communication among the library staff, particularly evident in our morning meetings, which creates a supportive and collaborative environment. While one of EAC's best features is its strong commitment to creating specialized study environments for various student groups, as seen in the dedicated libraries we toured. Furthermore, their efficient book processing, which seamlessly combines Koha editing on the computer with thorough manual handling, demonstrates a truly comprehensive approach to organization. Moreover, EAC Librarians ensures that all library materials are well-maintained, easily accessible, and properly managed from acquisition to shelving.
