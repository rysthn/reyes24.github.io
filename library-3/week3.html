    <h2>A. Meaningful Experiences</h2>
    <p>This week was very interesting for me because I got to learn all about how acquisition works, such as buying new books, which Sir Sherwin assigned. One of my most meaningful experiences was when Sir Sherwin gave me the lists of courses and budgets of every course for buying books. He also gave us advice about becoming an acquisition librarian someday. He said we need to make sure to be fair and honest with money and the choices we make every day. After acquisition, I was assigned to the marketing team with Ma'am Rizza. She gave us tasks where we got to pick out books for Father's Day and World Environment Day, which was a fun way to use what we know. Even making the posters for WGSN and BoF was a real challenge for me.</p>

    <h2>B. Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>During my stay here at Benilde, I truly learned how important it is to be open and honest when you're dealing with books and money in the library, just like Sir Sherwin taught us. I also figured out how to make those book request lists, making sure we get affordable yet quality books without spending too much. When I moved to marketing, I saw how much effort goes into promoting the library. I also realized that it's so important to promote the library's services, resources, and to have programs that align with every monthly event in order to make patrons well engaged in library activities.</p>

    <h2>C. Best Practices and Best Features of the Library</h2>
    <p>What I've observed in the Benilde library is that they are very organized when it comes to their respective roles. They also ensure every program request is checked carefully, and they acquire good quality materials that are also affordable since they have a lot of options, such as publishers for book acquisition. Their marketing is top-notch too, they really have platforms to promote the library and inform people about their collections and services, like making those cool videos and social media posts, and it's all managed by a marketing librarian. Furthermore, they are transparent about everything they do, from their money to how they manage resources, which is a great example. And I can tell they're always trying to get better, like that "before and now" video in the promotion shows how they've improved their spaces and services.</p>
