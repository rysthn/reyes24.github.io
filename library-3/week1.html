    <h2>A. Meaningful Experiences</h2>
    <p>My first week was a big adjustment for me with many new things to learn and to expect. I really enjoyed getting to meet everyone on the library staff, like Ma'am Marvs and Sir Abe, they were all very welcoming to interns like me. Helping students at the library was a highlight for me, whether it was showing them how to print or finding specific books, especially since printing is one of the services offered here at Benilde. Moreover, I found it especially meaningful to shelf-read and locate books for users. Furthermore, Sir Abe was a very good mentor and supervisor to me, he taught me to read shelving and reshelvings of books on the very first day I was assigned to the Reference Section.</p>

    <h2>B. Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>I learned that patience is key and self study especially when helping all kinds of students, including those who are deaf. I quickly got how to process books for borrowing and returning using the automated machine, which was really easy and useful. On the other hand, putting books back on the shelves, or shelving, was a bit tricky at first, but I picked up good tips from Sir Abe and the other staff. I also got to see how to use important online tools like Scopus since it was my task so I was able to familiarize myself.</p>

    <h2>C. Best Practices and Best Features of the Library</h2>
    <p>I can say that the Benilde’s library's automated system for checking books in and out is super efficient and a great feature. I also think it's excellent that they offer online help through Larcy Chat (It is operated by librarians) so students can get answers to their queries. The staff here in Benilde are really good at teaching interns, which made my first week easier for me. They make sure everyone feels welcome and knows what to do for their respective tasks. The library also has a wide variety of books and helpful services like printing, making it a truly useful place for everyone.</p>
