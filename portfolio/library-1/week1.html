      <h2>A. Meaningful Experiences</h2>
      <p>
        I was initially somewhat anxious about what would happen on my first day or, perhaps more accurately, my first week at NCCA, but guess what? The fact that this is my first library assignment makes me very happy. It seemed like I entered a completely different environment. We had the opportunity to tour the building, which was much larger and more fascinating than I had expected due to the ground floor's mini museum. The first assignment we were given was to create an AVP for the month of our choice, which I chose to be April. Actually, I was able to enjoy it; it was like having a little creative freedom. The next few days were spent on the technical tasks, such as auditing and encoding books. Moreover, Ma'am Jelome the librarian taught us how to make flyleaf for books without it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We contributed to the parade's arts month props! We saw Catriona Grey, and it was exciting to see how much preparation goes into those events. We also serve both internal and external clients. It was satisfying to genuinely assist our clients in meeting their needs. Additionally, there were surveys and meetings that gave me a behind-the-scenes look. To be honest, I learnt a lot about people and culture within the NCCA.
      </p>

      <h2>B. Lesson Learned</h2>
      <p>
        I had an exciting and very helpful first week at the library. I soon discovered that it serves a variety of purposes and is much more than just a place to read comfortably. I had to constantly turn between making video presentations and carefully classifying and arranging books. I learnt from this how important it is to be flexible and adaptive because I work in a special library. Although the Library does not currently have a specific or standard classification, it still operates and provides resources to the external clients well. Additionally, I noticed how innovative the NCCA is in marketing Arts Month and how enjoyable the technical work of library management is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, knowing the NCCA's activities calendar made it easier for me to observe how the library interacts with the community at large. And for me, I learned that effective time management was essential to completing all of the assignments and tasks given to us. Collaborating with my peers on various tasks let me realise how important cooperation is.
      </p>

      <h2>C. Best Practices and Best Features of the Library</h2>
      <p>
        Based on my observations and experiences throughout my week-long stay at the NCCA Library, the following best practices and best features of the library are: First of all, I was genuinely impressed by their organisation. Beginning with our first-day orientation, the librarian and our supervisor are incredibly friendly and approachable. Additionally, the building tour helped me get settled in right away. The way they promoted the library's events and resources using AVP impressed me. I also observed that NCCA ambassadors did so much in order to promote the organisation. In addition, the Terminal report area is one of the library's best features and is crucial to the NCCA because it houses all of the documented projects that are granted by NCCA. And lastly, the effort they put into making the resources available that the clients needed was something I noticed and appreciated.
