      <h2>A. Meaningful Experiences</h2>
      <p>
        Our last week at NCCA was a combination of learning about art and completing crucial administrative tasks in the records section. We went to another talk or lecture about Juan Luna's painting, and I believed it was an excellent way to learn more about our history. My daily work in the office involves evaluating old documents, which has sharpened my attention to detail. Additionally, we trained the second group of interns on document handling and organization since they came, which was a great chance to collaborate, such as processing official documents and taking phone calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, routing and logging documents on a regular basis taught me how crucial it is to have accurate records in order for the office or organization to function properly. Numerous similar chores filled each day, emphasizing the importance of consistency in record-keeping. I came to understand the importance of the records department in maintaining an organization's operations and history. We interns had a productive week overall, with each day being loaded with worthwhile work.
      </p>

      <h2>B. Lesson Learned</h2>
      <p>
        I learned the importance of establishing a balance between routine and learning this week in the Records Management Section. Attending the Juan Luna lecture made it clear that daily work can be enhanced by professional development that arises from unexpected sources. The daily appraisal and processing of papers taught me the value of thorough work in records administration. My personal understanding of approaches was strengthened by guiding peers, proving that instruction strengthens learning. Processing documents and taking calls highlighted the need of following rules and communicating clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I came to recognize that even seemingly repetitive duties, such as document routing and logging, are essential to organizational effectiveness. The significance of organized processes for controlling the flow of information was emphasized throughout the week. I noticed that records management is about maintaining institutional culture and making certain procedures run smoothly, not just about papers. Lastly, I realized that reaching daily objectives and helping everyone succeed as a whole require commitment and consistency.
      </p>

      <h2>C. Best Practices and Best Features of the Library</h2>
      <p>
        The Records Management Section, in my opinion, demonstrated a number of best practices that are essential to the effectiveness of an organization. The organized daily schedule, which used standardized logging and routing techniques to guarantee consistent document processing, was a crucial component. A proactive approach to handling physical records was demonstrated by the systematic appraisal of papers for disposal. The section's commitment to properly processing official instructions and memorandums demonstrated its function in preserving operational flow. Additionally, the staff is very courteous to us. In my opinion, the Records and Library section's best feature is the staff itself, since they are excellent communicators and treat the OJTs with respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, a transparent and easily available record of every transaction was made possible by the practice of carefully recording all incoming paperwork. The section demonstrated a commitment to ongoing development by skilfully incorporating outside learning, such as the NCCA lecture, into their workflow. Additionally, the readiness to impart expertise by mentoring other interns highlighted a cooperative and encouraging atmosphere. One of the best features for keeping memos in order was the well-organised vertical folder system. Finally, the section's commitment to productivity was validated by the regular completion of given duties each day, as seen by the documented work hours.
