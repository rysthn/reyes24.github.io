      <h3> Head Librarian - <strong>Ma'am Erlinda Gonzalez</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Ma'am Erlinda</strong> is the Head Librarian at EAC. She is not only kind but also a very jolly person, and I found her career path redirection during our orientation truly inspiring. She has been organizing the library's functions since she started working here, also addressing previous management challenges. With that, I deeply admire her ability to draw upon her experiences to continuously improve the library's collections and environment, and to guide and help her staff become more professional and productive in their roles.</p>

      <h3> Manual/Archives Section - <strong>Ma'am Nicole</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Ma'am Nicole</strong> is assigned to the manual processing area. When I met her, she was very approachable and kind, and we got along easily. On our first day, she was also the one we spoke with about our career aspirations. Furthermore, she patiently taught us the manual processes for preparing books, including adding call numbers and barcodes. I really enjoyed working with her.</p>

      <h3>Acquisition Section - <strong>Sir Carlo Paloyo</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Sir Carlo</strong>, the Acquisition Librarian here at EAC, I found particularly inspiring, especially since his age isn't too far from our own. Based on my observation when we were assigned to cataloging, he is a hardworking and knowledgeable individual, not only in acquisition but also in the broader functions of the library. I also observed that Sir Carlo is easy to get along with, and he became one of the librarians we felt close to. Though we had lots of questions during our internships, he was incredibly patient with all of them.</p>

      <h3>Medical Section - <strong>Ma'am Vanessa Tamayo</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Ma'am Vanessa</strong> is responsible for the Medical Section of the library. While I initially thought she might have a reserved nature, I quickly learned that she is also kind and exceptionally knowledgeable about all aspects of the library.</p>

      <h3>Periodical Section - <strong>Ma'am Gloren Cutanda</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Ma'am Gloren</strong> is assigned to the Periodical Section. She was always very kind to us and has a soft-spoken character. I also admire her extensive knowledge in the processes of recataloging and reaccessioning books that require such attention.</p>

      <h3>Front Desk Section - <strong>Sir Sonny Saban (Dos)</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Sir Sonny Saban (Dos)</strong> is in charge of the front desk, where students tap their IDs. He is a kind and responsible individual who also handles some of the library's technical tasks. Every lunch, he tends to tell us jokes and humor that lighten the mood in the room.</p>

      <h3> Circulation Area</h3>
      <p><strong>Ma'am Jhune Capuli</strong> is the librarian in charge of the Circulation area. She's really kind and seems to be around Sir Carlo's age too. When I was reassigned to work on the Koha system for the junior and senior high school Filipiniana books, she was the one who taught me everything.</p>
      <p><strong>Ma'am Rodora Castro (Dors)</strong> is like a mother figure to us interns. She's been at Emilio Aguinaldo College for so long and even graduated with a BLIS degree. She's in charge of manually processing the books, like putting on the color-coded stickers, call numbers, and plastic covers.</p>
      <p><strong>Sir Ryan Baldera</strong> is so kind, a joker, and always ready to help me whenever I have questions about the manual processing tasks I'm assigned. He's also really patient with all my questions, and I noticed that he was strict when it comes to stamping accession numbers in every book.</p>
      <p><strong>Ma'am Ailyn Pilapil</strong> is the librarian assigned to the school library.</p>
      <p><strong>Sir Justine Castro</strong> works at the front desk in the Circulation Area.</p>
