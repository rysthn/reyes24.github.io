      <h2>A. Meaningful Experiences</h2>
      <p>
        My third week in the circulation area was incredibly interesting and genuinely enjoyable. I gained insight into the entire process of how books are borrowed and loaned. The manual processing of books, which includes applying covers and call numbers, really highlighted the meticulous attention to detail involved in preparing each item. I also had the opportunity to process a significant number of books, and it felt very rewarding to assist students with their borrowing, returning, and clearance requirements. Although it was sometimes challenging to understand students who spoke English differently, particularly those from India and Nigeria, these interactions were crucial. I was still able to help them effectively, and these diverse exchanges truly underscored the wide range of students the library serves daily. Successfully navigating these interactions significantly built my confidence.
      </p>

      <h2>B. Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        During my third week of the internship here at EAC, I deeply learned that patience and being a good listener are paramount skills in librarianship. Sir Ryan expertly demonstrated the correct way to perform manual processing, and Ma'am Jhune taught me how to recatalog books, even those being moved to different sections. This emphasized that there's always something new to learn in this field. Engaging with diverse students, even when understanding them was a bit difficult, taught me the importance of striving my absolute best to help everyone, regardless of communication differences. It truly reinforced the value of flexibility and a genuine desire to assist every person who comes to the library.
      </p>

      <h2>C. Best Practices and Features of the Library</h2>
      <p>
        As I've noted before, the library is exceptionally organized in its operations. The careful processing of books and the time taken to recatalog them, even old books, demonstrate a strong commitment of EAC to maintaining everything in good condition and ensuring easy access for students. This allows students to always find what they need. Another aspect I truly appreciate is how helpful and supportive everyone is. Sir Ryan and Ma'am Jhune consistently took the time to explain procedures and assist me whenever I had questions, which made me feel much more comfortable and confident in my tasks.
